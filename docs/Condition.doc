    C4G implements a very basic Design by Contract framework. In C4G, a
    Contract is an implicit control structure defined as one of more
    Conditions. The Contract is satisfied is none of its Conitions panic.

TYPES

type Condition struct {
    Ident string
}
    A Condition is decoupled from its Execute method, which means we may
    declare and reuse our Condtion objects

func (c Condition) Execute(b bool)
    This method defines the Contract's expectations. The bool param must be
    true for control to pass back to enclosing (function) scope

type Conditional interface {
    // contains filtered or unexported methods
}
    A Conditional takes a bool and panics if that bool is false, hence the
    contract is broken
